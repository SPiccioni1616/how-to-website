            <h1> Directions</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Step one</h2>
            <h3>In a large bowl, sift together (or whisk) the cake flour, bread flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Set aside.</h3>
            <br>
            <h2>Step two</h2>
            <h3>In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment mix the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together for 5 minutes, until light and fluffy. Add in the eggs one at a time until mixed, and then vanilla. Continue mixing for an additional minute, scraping the sides as necessary.</h3>
            <br>
            <h2>Step three</h2>
            <h3>Turn mixer to low and add in the flour mixture, until just combined. Fold in the chocolate until evenly incorporated. Cover and chill dough for 24-72 hours..</h3>
            <br>
            <h2>Step four</h2>
            <h3>When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat.</h3>
            <br>
            <h2>Step five</h2>
            <h3>Allow the chilled dough to sit out at room temperature for 20-30 minutes before baking to soften slightly. Scoop out 3.5 ounces of dough for each cookie, using a large cookie scoop. This is approximately 1/4 cup. Place mounds onto your baking sheet, spacing them 3- inches apart.</h3>
            <br>
            <h2>Step six</h2>
            <h3>Bake cookies for 15-18 minutes, until the edges are golden. Turn your baking sheet 180- degrees once, halfway through baking.</h3>
            <br>
            <h2>Step seven</h2>
            <h3>Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle with sea salt. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>NOTE</h1>
            <br>
            <h3>Instead of chilling the dough in a large bowl, you can scoop and measure your dough right away and chill it in prepared mounds on a large baking sheet until ready to bake. Baking chilled dough produces a slightly thicker cookie than room temperature dough.</h3>
